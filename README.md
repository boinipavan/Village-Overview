# Village-Overview
I have developed an interactive frontend project titled "Village Overview" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project offers a dynamic virtual showcase of a village, highlighting its picturesque landmarks, various shops, and detailed descriptions of the services they provide. Additionally, the platform includes comprehensive information about government officials, enabling users to easily access key contacts and resources. Furthermore, users can report and address village-related issues through a dedicated section. This project demonstrates my proficiency in frontend development, user interface design, and problem-solving, showcasing my ability to create engaging and impactful web applications for community engagement and development.
